HELLO

This is a simple python program to download youtube videos as both audio and video

Using the pytube library https://pytube.io/en/latest/

simply choose between an audio or video downloader in the program then provide the link in the video.

Note: please use the link provided when you "Share" a youtube video rather than just copying the URL. pytube throws a regex error when attempting to just search for the URL link
